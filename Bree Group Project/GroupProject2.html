            <p>Whether it is magnificant temples, alternative fashion, or weird and wonderful food, Japan seems to be the place to go for those who want to experience a completely different culture. However, travel to this extraordinary country can get quite
                pricy. Here are some tips to help you save you hard-earned cash while still being able to experience Japan's wonders. </p>

        <p>Capsule hotels may look like they are straight out of a Sci-Fi, but these nifty pods not only are clean, but great for those who are looking for a place to spend for a night or two. A capsule hotel is a type of hotel developed in Japan that features
            many small bed-sized rooms known as capsules. Capsule hotels provide cheap, basic overnight accommodation for guests who do not require or who cannot afford larger, more expensive rooms offered by more conventional hotels. The advantages of
            these hotels is that you can meet other travellers, enjoy a good location at a small price, and experience a space-ship like night's sleep next to the neon lights of Tokyo. The only downside is that, being so close to your neighbours, it can
            get quite noisy, so make sure you bring earbuds! Sometimes, they are provided. <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/jp/nine-hours-shinjuku-north.en-gb.html" target="_blank">9 hours is a popular chain around Tokyo.</a><br>

        <p>Hostels are the go-to for students and young travellers all around the world, yet they come with costs. The closeness to others without the protective cocoon you get in the capsule hotel may be intrusive to some, and pleasing to others, yet it
            comes at an added risk. Japanese hostels, on the other hand, do not hold as much a negative stigma. They are clean and not as scruffy as others around the world, and have a warm an exciting atmosphere, with some having their own unique themes
            (and sometimes a bar!) yet I recommend this accommodation type for travellers in groups. Safety in numbers! Book and Bed Asakusa is a very cute choice. <a href="https://www.hostelworld.com/hosteldetails.php/Book-And-Bed-Tokyo-Asakusa/Tokyo/281524"

        <p> Ramen is perhaps the most popular Japanese food in the West (aside from sushi!), but what exactly is it? Simply put, ramen is a Japanese noodle soup, with a combination of a rich flavoured broth, one of a variety of types of noodle and a selection
            of meats or vegetables, often topped with a boiled egg. In Japan ramen is considered a fast food, with many small restaurants and street vendors offering a warming bowl of this delicious soup.The dish of ramen is heavily regionalised, with
            different variations served in different areas of Japan, although all variations are based on the same broth and noodle concept. Take a look at the different styles of ramen available and the ingredients they feature below â€“ Ramen Broth Styles
            One of the essential ingredients in Ramen is the broth, making up a vast majority of the final dish.

        <p> This is hands down my most favourite Japanese dish. Abura soba is a new type of ramen which has been quite popular in Japan. ... But it is actually delicious and healthier then normal ramen. It consists of thick noodles, toppings, and most importantly,
            it has "tare" (thick soy sauce) on the bottom of the bowl instead of soup. It can be very oil and garlic heavy, but at most places, you can change the level of garlic to fit your tastes. This is hands down my most favourite Japanese dish.

        <p>Meiji Shrine is a shrine dedicated to the deified spirits of Emperor Meiji and his consort, Empress Shoken. Located just beside the JR Yamanote Line's busy Harajuku Station, Meiji Shrine and the adjacent Yoyogi Park make up a large forested area
            within the densely built-up city. The spacious shrine grounds offer walking paths that are great for a relaxing stroll. The shrine was completed and dedicated to the Emperor Meiji and the Empress Shoken in 1920, eight years after the passing
            of the emperor and six years after the passing of the empress. The shrine was destroyed during the Second World War but was rebuilt shortly thereafter. This is not one of the most popular tourist attrations, but it is a hidden gem worth seeing.

        <p>The Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building in Shinjuku is often visited by tourists for its free observation decks which provide good panoramic views of Tokyo and beyond. The 243 meter tall building has two towers, and each houses an observatory
            at a height of 202 meters. It had been the tallest building in Tokyo until it was overtaken by the Midtown Tower in 2007. With favorable weather conditions, famous landmarks such as Mount Fuji, the Tokyo Skytree, Tokyo Tower, Meiji Shrine
            and the Tokyo Dome can be seen from the observatories. Each observatory has a cafe and a souvenir shop.

        <p>The Ginza is Tokyo's most famous upmarket shopping, dining and entertainment district, featuring numerous department stores, boutiques, art galleries, restaurants, night clubs and cafes. One square meter of land in the district's center is worth
            over ten million yen, making it one of the most expensive real estate in Japan. It is where you can find the infamous $10 cups of coffee and where virtually every leading brand name in fashion and cosmetics has a presence. From 1612 to 1800,
            today's Ginza district was the site of a silver coin mint (Ginza means "silver mint" in Japanese), after which the district was eventually named. The Ginza evolved as an upmarket shopping district following the 1923 Great Kanto Earthquake.
